Postgres based background processing worker system thing.
:warning: Somewhat usable, see `dev-resources/taskmaster/` directory for samples and examples

Recommended environment:

- Linux
- Postgres 11
- JDK 11
- Clojure 1.10.1

Required:



- HikariCP connection pool



> will probably work with Postgres 9.6, Clojure 1.9 and JDK 8.


# Usage


## Database setup

You'll need a Postgres server, and a databsae created. Then you can create the necessary jobs table structure:

> :warning: This has to run before you start any consumers, as they will attempt to fetch any unprocessed jobs while starting!

```clojure
(taskmaster.operation/create-jobs-table! jdbc-connection)

```

## Defining handlers for consuming jobs

Now you can define your consumers, and a handler function which will process each job. If processing is done, return `:taskmaster.operation/ack` qualified symbol. If not, return `:taskmaster.operation/reject`.

Example:


```clojure

(defn handler [{:keys [payload]}]
  (if (do/some-other-work payload)
    :taskmaster.operation/ack
    :taskmaster.operation/reject))
```


Rejecting a job will *keep the failed job data in the jobs table* so that you can:

- requeue it by using `(taskmaster.operation/requeue! conn {:id [faild-job-id-1 failed-job-id-2]})`
- implement a garbage collector and delete them some other time

Failed jobs can be found by querying for `run_count > 0` or via


```clojure
(taskmaster.operation/find-failed-jobs conn {:queue-name queue-name})
```

## Consuming

Let's define a consumer:

```clojure
(def consumer
  (taskmaster.queue/start! db-conn {:queue-name "do_work_yo"
                                    :handler handler
                                    :concurrency 3}))


```

Consumer will spin up 1 listener thread to be notified about new reocrds being inserted matching the queue name and 3 threads to process these jobs, in parallel, one at a time.

## Publishing

Now let's queue up some jobs:


```clojure

(taskmaster.queue/put! db-conn {:queue-name "do_work_yo" :payload {:send-email "test@example.com"}})
```

By default, job payloads are stored as JSON and Taskmaster is setup to serialize/deserialize it using Cheshire.


# Next steps

That's it, you can now add other fun things like:

- use the [middleware pattern](http://clojure-doc.org/articles/cookbooks/middleware.html) to add instrumentation and error reporting
  - see example middlewares here: [test/taskmaster/middleware_test.clj](test/taskmaster/middleware_test.clj)
- spin up multiple consumers to consume from many "queues"
- add some sort of schema validation when pushing/pulling data off the queue


## Components

[Component](https://github.com/stuartsierra/component) approach is recommended, but it's not stricly necessary.
At minimum you'll need

- HikariCP connection pool component
- Consumer component(s)

Publisher is not necessary, as you can ivoke `taskmaster.queue/put!` directly, but it's good to have one anyway, especially in tests.

### Messy example


```clojure
(require '[taskmaster.dev.connection :as c]
         '[taskmaster.component :as com]
         '[clojure.tools.logging :as log]
         '[com.stuartsierra.component :as component])

;; stores all payloads
(def qs (atom []))


;; `component` is the whole consumer component here - so you have access to its' dependencies
(defn handler [{:keys [id queue-name payload component] :as job}]
  (log/infof "got-job t=%s q=%s %s" component queue-name payload)
  (swap! qs conj id)
  (log/info (count (set @qs)))
  ;; fail the job if some-number in the payload is not even
  (let [res   (if (and (:some-number payload) (even? (:some-number payload)))
                :taskmaster.operation/ack
                :taskmaster.operation/reject)]
    (log/info res)
    res))


(def system
  {:db-conn (c/make-one)
   :consumer (component/using
              (com/create-consumer {:queue-name "t3"
                                    :handler handler
                                    :concurrency 2})
              [:db-conn :some-thing])
   :some-thing {:some :thing}
   :publisher (component/using
               (com/create-publisher)
               [:db-conn])})


(def SYS
  (component/start-system (component/map->SystemMap system)))


(com/put! (:publisher SYS) {:queue-name "t3" :payload {:some-number 2}})

;; wait a sec
(component/stop SYS)

```

# How does this work?

There are three core parts:

- Postgres' `LISTEN / NOTIFY` triggers and functions
- an internal `j.u.c ConcurrentLinkedQueue`
- Postgres' `select ... FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED`

When the job table is setup, there's a trigger added to send `NOTIFY` whenever a new record is inserted. Then Taskmaster sets up a listener to receive pings
whenever inserts happen. These pings are sent over a `ConcurrentLinkedQueue` to a pool of threads, which
pull all job payloads from the table via a transaction and ensure atomicity via `SELECT ... FOR ... SKIP LOCKED`.

# Dependencies

Taskmaster is built on top of:

- `clojure.tools.logging` for logs (this repo uses logback as the backend)
- `cheshire` serialization for JSONB +
- `next.jdbc`
- `hikari-cp` - connection pool
- `hugsql`  all of the queries

Most of it's wrapped by `nomnom/utility-belt.sql` to smooth out the rough edges




# Roadmap

*Unreleased officialy, check on Clojars*

- [x] :bug: fix a bug where restarting consumers will pick up previously failed jobs
- [ ] non-deleting mode, where ackd jobs stay in the table, this is useful for reprocessing jobs or gathering some extra metrics

- [ ] verify this actually works in production workloads
- [ ] pluggable serialization (avro, simple text, etc) - maybe via middleware?
- [ ] remove HugSQL and `nomnom/utility-belt.sql` to use `next.jdbc` directly
